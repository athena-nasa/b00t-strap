                <p>We <span class="text-primary">Supernovas</span> are a group of five people who want to make some sort of effect. We believe that children –homeless and non homeless ones- are the key to success and a bright future. We’re hoping to be the meeting point between some of the previous organizations that had something to do with helping homeless children to provide them with a better life or at least basic needs. They’re only children and already have the whole world’s weight on their shoulders, no child should feel this way. Almost all street children didn’t choose this life and were forced to live on the street, that’s why we should stop hating on them and try to help in any way possible.</p>

                    <p>Street children are usually there for each other. They help each other cope with the street life by explaining where to live, how to earn money and what should be done in case a problem happens. They usually do work that doesn't require any technical skills. Some of the work done by street children is begging, washing cars or shop windows, selling paper tissues on the streets, working temporarily in shops or factories informally, collecting plastic from wastes to sell to recycling factories, shining shoes, carrying luggage in the markets for people and selling newspapers.</p>

                <p>Street children are exposed to a lot of problems daily. One of these problems is violence. For example, violence inside the street children groups and violence from the surrounding community that doesn’t approve of their presence. Violence is often associated with sexual abuse which younger street children and street females are exposed to. Another problem that street children face is the community disapproval. Street children are rejected by society. They are not accepted due to their appearance and behavior. People generally tend to drive street children away as a result of fear and disgust. Street children are facing a serious problem which is free usage of drugs and substances that lead them to lose consciousness, suffer from continuous disorientation and spending all their daily earnings. Absence of good model and refusal of society lead to prevailing frustration of the street children and losing of hope in any good future. There are approximately 48 million young ones whose are not registered in their country's archives, which represents around 47% of the child population around the world. This is a huge problem as those poor kids do not have identity, which exclude them from other right like the right to vote or the right to have a proper education or even low level education.</p>

                <div id="fifth" class="tab-pane ">
                <p>As they say, for every cause there is an effect, and there are devastating effects on street children themselves and on the society they belong to. The children without education are without future, which means that they will not be able to defend their future and they will face lots of difficulties to have a better life. Furthermore, criminal gangs which really represent a huge disaster, as they use those unregistered children to turn them into criminals. Those children have no criteria to know what is right and what is wrong. They may expose themselves to very cruel situations like prostitution, sexual violations, drug consumption and other forms of modern slavery. When children grow to be adults, they will be the best shape for crime. All of this means that street children of today will be criminals of tomorrow.</p>

                <p>Street children are known for most people as one of Egypt's serious problems. It is a term for children who are living on the streets of a city, town, or village, experiencing poverty, homelessness or both. They are divided into children "On" the street and children "Of" the streets. Children "On" the streets are the children who have a home to live in, but they have a full time work or a part time work. Children "Of" the streets are the children with no shelter except for the street. Based on the records of Al-Amal Village in Cairo, estimated that the number of street children in Egypt, both males and females is 93,000, ranging from 3 to 17 years old, so Egypt is one of the countries with the highest number of street children.</p>
